## PRIMARY COLLECTION

### Root 1: Emotional / Relational > Present Emotion > Sadness > Disappointment > Personal Experience
The surface of Gabi's reactions often looks like anger — big, loud, intense. But underneath the fire, the root emotion is sadness. Specifically, disappointment. She builds something beautiful in her imagination — how the day will go, how a game will work, what someone will say — and when the real version doesn't match, what she experiences is a loss. The imagined version was real to her, and now it's gone. That's grief. The anger is the armor around the grief.

### Root 2: Nervous System / Stress Regulation > Developmental Pattern > Fight Response > Hyperarousal
When the disappointment hits, her nervous system doesn't ramp up gradually — it spikes. Zero to 100. This is a developmental pattern in how her system learned to process the gap between expectation and reality. The fight response isn't aggression in the intentional sense — it's a system that floods with activation and doesn't have a graduated response available yet. Hyperarousal: everything is too much, too fast, too loud, all at once.

### Root 3: Cognitive / Belief-Based > Limiting Belief > Control Beliefs > "If I let go things fall apart" > Absorbed
The belief underneath the pattern. Gabi's system holds the conviction that things must go as she pictured them, because when they don't, it feels like everything is falling apart. The "letting go" isn't a choice she's making — it's something being forced on her by reality, and it feels catastrophic. Read as Absorbed rather than formed from personal experience — this pattern was in the atmosphere around her, a way of relating to expectations that she took in from her environment.

### Root 4: Somatic Patterning > Autonomic Body Response > Autonomic Regulation Patterns > Sympathetic Dominance
In her body: sympathetic nervous system fires hard and fast, parasympathetic (calming) system can't keep up. The body doesn't know how to downshift once activated. This is why the reactions feel so big and last so long — not just an emotion, but a body state that has to run its course because the regulation mechanism is underdeveloped or overridden.

## ASSOCIATED PATHWAYS

- Emotional / Relational > Present Emotion > Overwhelm > Collapse (the flooding/meltdown)
- Emotional / Relational > Present Emotion > Anger > Irritation (the surface expression that masks the sadness)

## RESTORATION

### Root 1: Disappointment
- **Readiness:** Yes. Openness here — she doesn't want to feel this way either.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Father, You gave Gabi an extraordinary imagination. She sees things in her mind with such color and detail — that is a gift from You. But right now, when reality looks different from what she imagined, it breaks something in her. She feels the loss as real grief. Lord, I ask You to heal the place where imagination and reality meet. Not by dulling her imagination — never that — but by giving her heart the capacity to receive what IS, even when it's different from what she pictured. Let her discover that Your version of things is often better than what she imagined, or at least that it's safe and good, even when it's different. Plant a seed of flexibility in her spirit — the ability to grieve the lost picture quickly and open her hands to what's actually here. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Tender. Something opened. Image of a hand unclenching.

### Root 2: Hyperarousal / Fight Response
- **Readiness:** Ready. This pattern is exhausting for her too.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Lord, Gabi's nervous system fires so fast and so hard when things don't go as expected. It's trying to protect her, but the protection is bigger than the threat. I ask You to recalibrate her arousal response. Where there has been a hair trigger, install a graduated dial. Give her system the ability to feel disappointment without flooding. Let the activation be proportional to what's actually happening, not to what the pattern has been. Bring the ramp-up time from instant to gradual, so she has a window — even a small one — between the trigger and the flood. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Felt mechanical — like a thermostat being reset. Clicked into a new setting. Complete.

### Root 3: "If I let go things fall apart" (ABSORBED BELIEF)
- **Readiness:** Some resistance. This belief gives her a sense of control. Releasing it means accepting she can't hold the world in place with her expectations.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Father, this belief is not Gabi's. She absorbed it. It was in the air. And it tells her that when things deviate from the plan, the world is falling apart. Lord, uproot this lie gently — she's small, and it's woven in. Replace it with truth: that You hold all things together, not her expectations. That when the picture changes, You are still in the picture. That flexibility is not loss of control — it is trust. Teach her young heart that letting go of her version doesn't mean everything collapses. It means something new is possible. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Resistance softened midway. Not fully complete in single pass — may have another layer. Acute edge gone. Seeds planted.

### Root 4: Sympathetic Dominance
- **Readiness:** Ready. Flows naturally from other roots clearing.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** God, You designed Gabi's autonomic nervous system. You built in both the accelerator and the brake. Right now the accelerator is overpowering the brake. I ask You to strengthen her parasympathetic response — the calming, settling, returning-to-rest part of her system. Where activation has dominated, let regulation grow. Give her body the experience of coming down from a spike, so it can learn the pathway. Build neural connections for recovery, for settling, for "I was upset and now I'm coming back." Not suppression — not forcing calm — but a genuine, embodied ability to return to rest after activation. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Physical foundation for everything else to land. Complete.

## POST-SESSION NOTES

4 roots across Emotional, Nervous System, Cognitive, and Somatic domains. Core pattern: vivid expectations form → reality deviates → system reads deviation as catastrophic (absorbed belief) → floods with activation (hyperarousal / sympathetic dominance) → outsized reaction expressing underlying disappointment. All restored, though Root 3 (absorbed belief) may need revisiting.

**Watch for:**
- Intensity of reactions — not whether they disappear, but whether the 0-to-100 spike softens
- Recovery time — does she come back from disappointment faster? Can she be redirected/comforted sooner?
- Spontaneous adaptation to changes of plan with less friction
- Root 3: parents may want to examine whether this pattern ("if I let go things fall apart") exists in themselves, since it was read as absorbed from the environment

## OBSERVATION ON ABSORBED BELIEF

Root 3 was identified as Absorbed — meaning it originated in Gabi's environment rather than her own experience. This may point to a parallel root in one or both parents worth addressing in a separate session.

## FOLLOW-UP: February 20, 2026 (Day 1 Post-Session)

Gabi is sick today, making it difficult to isolate session effects. However, parent notes she is handling being sick "pretty well" — no more whiny or irritable than normal, possibly less. Being sick is itself an unmet expectation (disrupted plans, not feeling how she wants to feel), so the response is mildly relevant but too confounded by illness to draw conclusions. Will continue observing.
