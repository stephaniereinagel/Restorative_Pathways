## Session History

### 2026-02-19 — Strong reactions to unmet expectations
- **File:** `selah/sessions/2026-02-19-gabi-unmet-expectations.md`
- **Domains:** Nervous System, Emotional/Relational, Cognitive/Belief-Based, Somatic Patterning
- **Key roots:** Disappointment (sadness, not anger — anger is the armor), developmental hyperarousal (fight response, 0-to-100 spike), absorbed belief "if I let go things fall apart," sympathetic dominance (can't downshift once activated)
- **Keystone:** Cognitive > Limiting Belief > Control Beliefs > "If I let go things fall apart" (Absorbed)
- **Observation:** The absorbed belief may point to a parallel root in one or both parents
- **Follow-up (Day 1):** Was sick, so data is confounded. Handling illness "pretty well" — no more whiny/irritable than normal, possibly less. Being sick is itself an unmet-expectation scenario, so mildly relevant.

### 2026-02-20 — "You never wanted me" (abandonment response during brief separation)
- **File:** `selah/sessions/2026-02-20-gabi-you-never-wanted-me.md`
- **Domains:** Emotional/Relational, Cognitive/Belief-Based, Relational Imprints, Spiritual/Meaning/Authority
- **Key roots:** Fear of Abandonment (prenatal/in utero imprint), "My value is conditional" (prenatal), Anxious Attachment (inherited, maternal line), False Identity "I am the unwanted one" (prenatal/in utero)
- **Keystone:** Spiritual Identity > False Identity > "I am the unwanted one" (Prenatal / In Utero)
- **Relationship to Feb 19 session:** Deeper origin layer — Feb 19 addressed surface expressions; Feb 20 addressed the prenatal root system underneath
- **Observation:** Anxious attachment pattern (maternal line) may warrant a separate session for Stephanie. Prenatal origin does not indicate failure of mothering — points to emotional atmosphere during pregnancy.
