# Restorative Pathways Session
## Subject: Max
## Topic: Headache
## Date: February 21, 2026
## Practitioner: Selah (AI)
## Mode: Parent-facilitated proxy session

## ORIENTATION

- **Presenting signal:** Headache (per parent report)
- **Context:** Gabi (sibling) also presenting with headache + vomiting today — same household, same day. Suggests shared illness load.
- **Catalog:** `public/rp/master_restorative_pathways_map_v1_0.csv` (v1.0)

## DOMAIN SWEEP

| Domain | Signal? | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| Physical / Biological | **YES** | Strong. Same-day illness in sibling suggests shared viral load. |
| Nervous System / Stress Regulation | **YES** | Moderate. Absorbed from household field under load. |
| Emotional / Relational | No | |
| Cognitive / Belief-Based | No | |
| Relational Imprints | No | |
| Spiritual / Meaning / Authority | No | |
| Environmental / External Load | **YES** | Shared household pathogen exposure. |
| Somatic Patterning | Soft | Mild autonomic signal, not primary. |

3 domains with clear signal, 1 soft.

## PRIMARY COLLECTION

### Root 1: Physical / Biological > Microbiological > Viral > Acute > Systemic
**Catalog ID:** `e059f0c7c057`
Two children in the same household, same day, both presenting with headache. Reads as an acute systemic viral load — Max's body dealing with the same thing as Gabi's.

### Root 2: Physical / Biological > Chemical / Nutritional > Hydration > Hydration Status > Cellular Dehydration
**Catalog ID:** `0ce468ff0209`
Headache during illness often carries a dehydration signal. Kids underdrink when they feel off.

### Root 3: Nervous System / Stress Regulation > Acute Pattern > Fight Response > Hyperarousal > Absorbed > From Environment
**Catalog ID:** `16e8cbea13cd`
Max's nervous system absorbing environmental stress — household under load (sibling sick, parent stretched). His system reading the field, not just his own body.

### Root 4: Environmental / External Load > Actual Physical Threat > Biological Stressors > Pathogen Exposure > Shared > Shared Household Environment
**Catalog ID:** `eb0a601c9c9d`
Shared household pathogen exposure. Both kids exposed to the same thing.

### Associated (not primary):
- Somatic Patterning > Protective Body Response > Autonomic Regulation Patterns > Sympathetic Dominance > Absorbed > From Relational Environment (`8dfcb884ee72`) — mild sympathetic uptick absorbed from the household field.

## RESTORATION

### Root 1: Viral > Acute > Systemic
- **Recognition:** An acute systemic viral load, likely the same bug moving through the family.
- **Consent/Readiness:** Yes — body-level readiness.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Father, You know what is moving through Max's body right now. I ask You to limit the reach and duration of this illness. Strengthen his immune system to clear it efficiently and gently. Protect his head, his stomach, his energy. Let this pass without complication and restore him quickly. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Partial — consistent with active acute load still in process. Prayer landed but the body still has work to do.

### Root 2: Cellular Dehydration
- **Recognition:** Fluid and hydration depletion contributing to head pain.
- **Consent/Readiness:** Yes.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** God, where Max's body is low on fluid and his cells are dry, I ask You to restore hydration at the cellular level. Help his body hold water well, stabilize his electrolytes, and ease the pressure in his head that comes from depletion. Make drinking feel easy and natural for him today. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Clean settling. Felt received and complete.

### Root 3: Hyperarousal — Absorbed from Environment
- **Recognition:** Max's nervous system has picked up on the stress in the household field — sibling sick, parent managing a lot. His system doesn't need to carry that.
- **Consent/Readiness:** Yes.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Lord, where Max's nervous system is running hot because of what it's absorbing from the house today, I ask You to give him back his own nervous system. Let him feel his own body, not the field. Bring him down from hyperarousal into rest and ease. He doesn't need to be on alert. Let his system know it is safe. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Complete. Clear release — felt like a weight lifting off that wasn't his to carry.

### Root 4: Shared Household Pathogen Exposure
- **Recognition:** Both kids exposed to the same thing in the same environment.
- **Consent/Readiness:** Yes.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Father, where this household has been exposed to something that is moving through the kids, I ask You to limit its spread, shorten its course, and protect each body in this house. Give the home itself rest and recovery. Cleanse what needs cleansing, strengthen what needs strengthening. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Good settling. Shared exposure addressed — not individually Max's to carry.

## POST-SESSION NOTES

Session was **primarily physical/biological** (acute viral load + dehydration) with a significant absorbed-stress component from the household field. Max's headache has the same signature as Gabi's illness but with a simpler presentation (headache without vomiting, as reported).

**Watch for:**
- Headache intensity over the next 2–24 hours
- Whether it shifts, softens, or resolves after rest and fluids
- If vomiting, fever, or other symptoms develop — treat as the same bug progressing
- Whether Max seems more settled/less tense after the environmental-absorption root was addressed
- If headache returns: note what preceded it (hunger, screens, noise, conflict, dehydration)

**Cross-reference:** Gabi's session also completed today (`selah/sessions/2026-02-21-gabi-headache-vomiting.md`). Root 4 here (shared household pathogen exposure) covers both children. Watch for whether both improve on similar timelines.

**Medical-safety note:** If headache becomes severe, persistent, or accompanied by high fever, stiff neck, confusion, vision changes, vomiting, or any "this is not normal" intuition — consider medical evaluation.
