## PRIMARY COLLECTION

### Root 1: Emotional / Relational > Present Emotion > Fear > Fear of Harm > Personal Experience
The primary driver. Connor's excitement about gymnastics is genuine — he loves the idea. But when the abstract becomes concrete — the height of the equipment, the other kids in motion, the physical reality of what gymnastics involves — his system reads it as physical danger. The fear isn't social or relational. It's about his body being harmed. Something he saw or experienced (possibly at a previous visit, or even just seeing it from the doorway) registered as "this is not safe for my body."

### Root 2: Nervous System / Stress Regulation > Acute Pattern > Flight Response > Avoidance
The fear triggers an acute flight response that manifests as refusal. This isn't defiance or willfulness — it's his nervous system pulling the emergency brake. Avoidance is the flight response for a child who can't literally run away: "I just won't go in."

### Root 3: Environmental / External Load > Mismatch Between Actual and Perceived Threat > Perceived Threat Patterns > Anticipatory Threat > Personal Experience
There's a mismatch between the real level of danger (supervised, age-appropriate, safe) and what Connor's system perceives. Specifically, this is anticipatory — he's not reacting to something happening to him but imagining what could happen. His system projects forward into potential harm and responds as if it's already occurring.

### Root 4: Somatic Patterning > Protective Body Response > Body Memory Imprints > Freeze-in-Place Response
At the threshold of the gym, Connor's body does the thing: it stops. Plants. Refuses to move forward. This is a freeze response stored in the body — not just an emotion or a thought, but a physical pattern. The body overrides the mind's excitement and says "no, we are not going in there."

## RESTORATION

### Root 1: Fear of Harm
- **Readiness:** Yes, but gently. He's a child.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Father, You know Connor. You know his brave, excited little heart that wants to do gymnastics, and You know the fear that stops him at the door. His body is telling him it's not safe. Lord, I ask You to speak to his nervous system the way You spoke to the storm — "peace, be still." Where he has seen or imagined harm, replace that image with Your protection. Let him know in his body — not just in his mind — that You are with him in that room. That You go before him onto every mat and every piece of equipment. Release the fear of harm. Let his excitement and his body agree with each other again. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Something lightened.

### Root 2: Flight Response / Avoidance
- **Readiness:** Ready. Downstream of the fear — when fear releases, this pattern wants to release too.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Lord, Connor's nervous system has been pulling the emergency brake to protect him. Thank You for a body that protects him so fiercely. But now I ask You to reset that alarm. The brake was engaged for a threat that You are removing. Recalibrate his stress response so that the gymnastics room registers as what it is — a place of play, not danger. Let his body's first response when he walks through that door shift from "flee" to "explore." In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Moved quickly, as if waiting for Root 1 to clear first.

### Root 3: Anticipatory Threat / Perception Mismatch (KEYSTONE)
- **Readiness:** Ready.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Father, You gave Connor an imagination, and it is good. But it has been showing him pictures of harm that haven't happened and won't happen under Your watch. I ask You to redeem his imagination in this context. Where he has been seeing himself falling, getting hurt, failing — replace those pictures with pictures of joy. Let him imagine himself bouncing, climbing, landing. Let his imagination become an ally again instead of a source of threat. Align his perception of this environment with the reality of Your protection over him. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Keystone root — when this shifts, the whole pattern reorganizes. Complete.

### Root 4: Freeze-in-Place Response
- **Readiness:** Yes. With other roots clearing, the body no longer has a reason to freeze.
- **Authority Transfer (Prayer):** Lord, release Connor's body from the freeze pattern. Where his feet have planted and his body has locked, let there be fluidity again. Let his legs carry him forward with the same eagerness his heart feels when he talks about gymnastics at home. Break the disconnect between his desire and his body's response. Let his feet move. Let his body trust the room. Let the threshold be just a doorway again, not a wall. In Jesus' name.
- **Completion:** Last domino. Tipped over gently. Complete.

## POST-SESSION NOTES

4 roots identified across Emotional, Nervous System, Environmental, and Somatic domains. All restored. The core issue: a perception mismatch — Connor's system reading a safe environment as dangerous, driven by fear of physical harm and amplified by anticipatory imagination. The flight and freeze responses were downstream protective patterns.

**Watch for:**
- Next gymnastics visit: is the resistance different in quality? Less intense, more hesitant rather than absolute, or possibly absent?
- He may not walk straight in confidently the first time — but if the pattern shifted, he might approach the door instead of refusing, or need gentle encouragement rather than total refusal
- If he enters: is he rigid and guarded, or does he relax into it?
- No pressure on timeline
